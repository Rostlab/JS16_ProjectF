              <p className="lead">“The past is already written, the ink is dry” – so says the teaser for the sixth season of the popular TV show Game of Thrones. And until recently, that’s what we at got.show believed too. It was nine long months ago, during the season five finale (“Mother’s Mercy”) that we saw our favorite character Jon Snow join his father in GoT heaven however. But now we have reason to believe that he’s going to stick around on earth with the rest of us for just a little longer. You don’t think so? Well .. you know nothing, Jon Snow. <a href="http://www.got.show/jon-snow-is-not-dead.html">Read more</a></p>

                Ever since king Robert dethroned the Targaryens, she has been seeking for a way to win back the Iron Throne.
                Let’s face it, the moment Daenerys let Drogo  kill her (admittedly annoying) brother, that's when we all knew that this young girl is
                playing to win. Here is why we believe that soon she be sitting on the Iron Throne. <a href="https://got.show/daenerys-targaryen.html">Read more</a></p>

                quite the understatement when you’re talking about multiple fatalities in the family. And “lately” refers to the
                very first season of Game of Thrones, where we all taught an impressive lesson on how little George R.R. Martin cares
                about his main characters.It seems like winter’s been coming and staying for Bran, Arya and Sansa. But what exactly have they been up to lately – and where are they heading? <a href="https://got.show/house-stark.html">Read more</a></p>

Back then, Ramsay was called Reek (because he stank) and he did Theon's bidding. But, all of a sudden, the tables have turned on Theon and from being a self-proclaimed Prince of Winterfell, he was a captive at the Dreadfort, propped up to be The bastard of Bolton's personal pet. From then on, Theon was Reek and Reek was Ramsay. And as Theon was sinking lower and lower (and losing some vital body parts), Ramsay was rising in the world. <a href="https://got.show/when-theon-met-ramsay.html">Read more</a></p>
