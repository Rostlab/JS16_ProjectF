# H1: Why Jon Snow is not dead
[“The past is already written, the ink is dry”]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxI8aPISq8I) – so says the teaser for the sixth season of the popular TV show Game of Thrones. And until recently, that’s what we at **got.show** believed, too. It was nine long months ago, during the season five finale (“Mother’s Mercy”) that we saw our favorite character **Jon Snow** join his father in GoT heaven however. But now we have reason to believe that he’s going to stick around on earth with the rest of us for just a little longer. You don’t think so? Well ...  **you know nothing, Jon Snow.**

## H2: Four reasons Jon Snow is still alive
### H3: Because our very own machine learning algorithm says so!
We at **got.show** are firm believers that artificial intelligence & machine learning can have a more beneficiary impact on humanity than [embarrassing us at our own games]( http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11213518/alphago-deepmind-go-match-5-result) – that’s why we **created an algorithm that calculates Game of Thrones characters’ [likelihood of death](https://www.got.show/machine-learning-algorithm-predicts-death-game-of-thrones)**! Luckily, **Jon Snow's predicted likelihood of death is only at 11%**, which is overall pretty low. You’ll be glad to know that another famous Northern bastard - [Ramsay Bolton]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_Bolton), for instance, is likelier to die first, his predicted likelihood of death is at over 60%! Furthermore, our algorithm tells us that being Lord Commander of the Night's Watch makes Jon Snow one of the safest guys in all of Westeros, since it is the title with the lowest death rate in the series.

### H3: He is way too popular to be killed off.
I know, I know – being popular couldn’t save a lot of our other favorite Game of Thrones characters, but with Jon it is different. Just see what an outrage the season five finale caused on Twitter using our Twitter Sentiment Analysis App – and then think about the gigantic plot twist of bringing him back from the dead!

### H3: Kit Harington (Jon Snow’s actor) has been spotted on set for the sixth season Game of Thrones!
[Read about it in the independent.](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/game-of-thrones-season-6-not-only-is-jon-snow-alive-but-he-s-wearing-stark-armour-a6669801.html). And if that’s still not enough for you, what do you think about this official HBO poster?

### H3: He just can’t be dead. Just can't!
I mean, who’s going to care of Sam and Gilly? Who will handle the wildlings? who will lead the way during the long night? Let me tell you one thing: If Leonardo di Caprio can drag himself through the freezing cold for weeks after [fighting a goddamn grizzly bear]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revenant_%282015_film%29), why shouldn’t Kit Harington survive a minor stabbing, huh? Huh??

**Still not convinced?** Then you’ll be glad to hear that the season 6 premiere of Game of Thrones is going to air on the 24th April 2016 so - [soon we everything will become clear!](http://www.daystillgameofthrones.com/)

Shortly after leading the wildlings to Castle Black to save them from the nearing White Walkers, Jon had to learn about Stannis Baratheon’s fate from Melisandre. Then the unthinkable happened. Where will we see him next? Stay tuned at got.show

@togiberlin Please make an infographic referencing the stats from this [ProjectB issue](https://github.com/Rostlab/JS16_ProjectB_Group6/issues/60#issuecomment-201949253). I’d only focus on Culture, Title & Gender info. Maybe emphasize Jon Snow’s survival change explicitly again when it comes to the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch.
Project F will be able to give you some guidelines on size & formatting while they’re arranging the template page.

## Placeholder 2) Twitter sentiment
Here we’ll just serve a view from ProjectD_Group4’s Twitter graph (my group). I’ve added startDate & endDate parameters to the function that creates the graph, so you can specify the default date Range when loading the tool. I’d go for something around May 20 – June 20 2015 (season finale aired on June 14th)

## Placeholder 3) GOT Map
Just our amazing Map with Jon Snow added as a character. I’d show all the available data.
