# H1: Why Jon Snow is not dead
[“The past is already written, the ink is dry”]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxI8aPISq8I) – so says the teaser for the sixth season of the popular TV show Game of Thrones. And until recently, that’s what we at **got.show** believed too. 9 long months after we saw our favourite character **Jon Snow** join his father up in GoT heaven in the season 5 finale “Mother’s Mercy” however, we have reason to believe that he’s going to stick around on earth with the rest of us for a little longer. You don’t think so? Well, then **you know nothing, Jon Snow.**

## H2: 4 reason Jon Snow is still alive
### H3: Our very own machine learning algorithm suggests it.
We at **got.show** are firm believers that artificial intelligence & machine learning can have a more beneficiary impact on humanity than [embarrassing us at our own games]( http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11213518/alphago-deepmind-go-match-5-result) – that’s why we **created an algorithm that calculates Game of Thrones characters’ likeliness of death**! Luckily, **Jon is only at 11.6%**, which is overall pretty low. You’ll be glad to know that [Ramsay Bolton]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_Bolton) for example is at over 60%! Furthermore, being Lord Commander of the Night's Watch makes him one of the safest guys in all of Westeros, since it is the title with the lowest death rate in the series.

> Culture, title & gender play a huge role in terms of survival chances on Games of Thrones. 

### H3: He is way too popular to be killed off.
I know, I know – being popular couldn’t save a lot of our other favourite Game of Thrones characters, but with Jon it’s different. Just see what an outrage the season 5 finale caused on Twitter with our Twitter Sentiment Analysis App – and then think about the gigantic plot twist of bringing him back to the living!

### H3: Kit Harington (Jon Snow’s actor) has been on set for the sixth season Game of Thrones! 
[Read about it in the independent.](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/game-of-thrones-season-6-not-only-is-jon-snow-alive-but-he-s-wearing-stark-armour-a6669801.html). And if that’s still not enough for you, what do you think about this official HBO poster?

### H3: He just can’t be dead.
I can’t even. Who’s going to care for Sam & Gilly? Who will handle the wildlings? Let me tell you one thing: If Leonardo di Caprio can drag himself through the freezing cold for weeks after [fighting with a goddamn grizzly bear]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revenant_%282015_film%29), why shouldn’t Kit Harington survive a minor stabbing, heh?

**Still not convinced?** Then you’ll be glad to hear that the season 6 premiere of Game of Thrones is going to air on the 24th April 2016 already - [soon we will know.](http://www.daystillgameofthrones.com/)

Shortly after leading the wildlings to Castle Black to save them from the nearing White Walkers, Jon had to learn about Stannis Baratheon’s fate from Melisandre. Then the unthinkable happened. Where will we see him next? Stay tuned at got.show

@togiberlin Please make an infographic referencing the stats from this [ProjectB issue](https://github.com/Rostlab/JS16_ProjectB_Group6/issues/60#issuecomment-201949253). I’d only focus on Culture, Title & Gender info. Maybe emphasize Jon Snow’s survival change explicitly again when it comes to the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch.
Project F will be able to give you some guidelines on size & formatting while they’re arranging the template page.

## Placeholder 2) Twitter sentiment
Here we’ll just serve a view from ProjectD_Group4’s Twitter graph (my group). I’ve added startDate & endDate parameters to the function that creates the graph, so you can specify the default date Range when loading the tool. I’d go for something around May 20 – June 20 2015 (season finale aired on June 14th)
