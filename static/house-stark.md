### H1: Will Bran, Arya & Sansa be the last of their kind in Game of Thrones?

House Stark of Winterfell has been having kind of a rough patch lately, don’t you think so? Although “rough patch” is quite the understatement when you’re talking about multiple fatalities in the family. And “lately” refers to the very first season of Game of Thrones, where we all taught an impressive lesson on how little George RR. Martin cares about his main characters.

It seems like winter’s been coming and staying for Bran, Arya and Sansa. But what exactly have they been up to lately – and where are they headed?

#### H2: Bran Stark

It’s been awfully quiet around Bran this year, since HBO decided to keep him from us during Season 5. While we can only hope someone got fired for that, we sure as hell are excited for his appearance in april! Remember season 4’s epic finale, where the young stark boy was promised [the ability to fly after meeting the three-eyed raven?]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YXnI3HgZbc) Seems like his buddy Hodor didn’t carry him around all this time for nothing after all. Or, how he likes to put it:

#### H2: Sansa Stark

Oh boy. Where do I start? Sansa’s been having a troubled family life ever since her dad passed away. After two unhappy marriages she has fled her husband yet again – with Theon Greyjoy by her side. Quite an unusual combination, after all they’ve been through, but I guess nothing unites people quite as well as a mutual disgust for Ramsay Bolton.
… That is of course, if they are still alive. Which is hard to say at this point – unless you calculate the likelihood with a machine learning algorithm, like the fancy one we’ve implemented right here on this page! Always looking out for fellow Game of Thrones fans here.
Currently, we estimate Sansa’s survival chances to be:

#### H2: Arya Stark

We’re not the only ones who’ve been kept dark when it comes to the Game of Thrones universe for the past few months. For Arya Stark, season 6 is going to look a lot like 50 Shades of Grey since she got punished with blindness by the Many-Faced-God for taking a life that wasn’t hers to take. I guess those things happen when you surround yourself with that kind of people. No reason to give us that look Arya, it’s certainly not our fault!

### H3: Wait a minute…
… didn’t we forget somebody here? Yes, we did! Jon Snow, the other children’s half-brother! <s>Oh, but he’s dead anyway</s> Wrong! He’s as fresh as a daisy. How we know? Machine learning. [See for yourself!](urltojonsnowlandingpage)
